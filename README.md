# TR7AE-010-Templates
My 010 Templates for Tomb Raider Legend/Anniversary, made with help by alphaZomega and TheIndra.

Not all the templates are finished (**anim, mesh_ps2, nextgen_mesh, objectdtpdata, savegame**)

The **mesh** template works with the PC mesh format (**GNC**) and allows you to do many things that can help you with modding (changing texture IDs, MaterialVertexColors, etc)
